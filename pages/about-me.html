<h2></h2>
<p>In the summer of 2019, I graduated from the University of Birmingham with a Bsc in Chemistry. My degree allowed me to use Java apps and programming to solve complex mathematical and modelling problems in Physical Chemistry. I have always been interested in technology, and recently, learnt how to build PCs from scratch and tailor PC builds for specific uses, such as business uses and animation development. In anticipation for a role in technology, I started using Udemy to undertake a Python course to develop necessary skills that will be helpful in my career.</p>
<p>My passion for technology and the desire to start a career in the industry led me to applying for the AWS re/Start programme. During the programme, I enjoyed covering the basics of Python and learning the security module. We also covered Linux and AWS core services in compute, networking and storage. My favourite AWS technology was AWS Lambda, serverless computing, which gives you the ability to upload code for any type of application and will automatically scale, depending on the workload. I am also intrigued by automation tools such as CloudFormation and the concept of CI/CD pipelines to automate workflows. During the programme, I wrote scripts in Bash and Python as we learned them, some of which are on my <a href="https://github.com/AmarBhogal">GitHub page</a>. Technology is constantly evolving and so I strive to continuously educate myself on new and developing technologies.</p>
<p>Since I was 18, I have been helping my dad at the family business (DIY shop) where I took on the responsibility to diagnose, troubleshoot and resolve a range of technical issues. This gave me experience in researching and problem-solving issues on my own and the confidence needed to tackle new problems in the future. I pride myself as a very self-motivated and a hardworking individual, who once is given a task, will strive to complete it without any hesitation. I have a lot of experience working in teams, which has allowed me to develop excellent communication skills and a great level of empathy that helps me work with people from all different types of backgrounds. All my experiences, including AWS re/Start, have made me a strong communicator and helped develop my problem-solving skills. Furthermore, my final year project, during my degree, has massively helped my research skills and my ability to ask the right questions. </p>
<p>My current goal is to continue to develop my skills with Python and AWS services, while I wish to learn more about AI and machine learning.  I am motivated to take the next step to further my career by undertaking the AWS Cloud Practitioner Exam and becoming a Cloud Engineer. I am currently keen to join a company that I can be of value to, by bringing my enthusiasm to learn, to face new challenges and to contribute to company targets.</p>
